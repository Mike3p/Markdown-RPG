#### Animate Dead

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | special

This spell turns the bones or bodies of dead creatures into undead skeletons or zombies that follow the caster's spoken commands. The caster may animate a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to twice his caster level each time he casts this spell. Animated skeletons have Hit Dice equal to the number the monster had in life; for skeletons of humans or demi-humans, this means one Hit Die, regardless of the character level of the deceased. Zombies have one more Hit Die than the monster had in life. An animated skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton; a zombie can be created only from a mostly intact corpse. The caster must touch the remains to be animated. Animate dead normally lasts for just one day, but the spellcaster can make the spell permanent by sprinkling 1 vial of unholy water per Hit Die on each zombie or skeleton. If this is done, the undead remain animated until they are destroyed or dispelled.

#### Atonement

| Range:    | 0'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | permanent

This spell removes the burden of unwilling evil acts or misdeeds from the subject. The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. Atonement may be cast to reverse magical alignment change. This complex spell takes 1 turn to cast.


#### Augury

| Range:    | self
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | see below

An augury can tell the caster whether a particular action will bring good or bad results in the immediate future. The base chance for receiving a true reply is 70% + 1% per caster level; this roll is made secretly by the Judge. The augury can see into the future only 3 turns, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the result. Thus, the result will not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.


#### Bless*

| Range:    | 0'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 6 turns

When cast before battle, bless gives the caster and his allies (within a 50' radius of the caster) a bonus of +1 to attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls (for monsters or NPCs allied with the caster), and saving throws against magical fear. It may not be cast on creatures who are already engaged in melee.

Divine spellcasters of 7th level or higher may also use bless to create holy water. One casting of bless will transform 1 pint of ordinary water into holy water. Casting bless in this manner demands a sacrifice to the caster's deity worth at least 10gp. Once created, holy water will retain its potency indefinitely so long as it is kept in the vial it was blessed in. See the [Equipment Descriptions](Chapter03.md#equipment-descriptions) in Chapter 3 for information on holy water.

The reverse of bless is called bane. It fills the caster's enemies (within a 50' radius) with fear and doubt, causing each affected character or monster to suffer a -1 penalty on attack throws, damage rolls, morale rolls, and saving throws against magical fear. Bane may also be used by chaotic divine casters of 7th level or higher, in conjunction with a sacrifice of at least 10gp, to create a vial of unholy water. Unholy water has beneficial effects when used in the animation of the dead. See Animate Dead, above.


#### Charm Animal

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | special

This spell allows the caster to charm an animal (including normal and giant animals but excluding humans, demi-humans, humanoids, and fantastic creatures) in much the same fashion as charm person. Unintelligent animals receive no saving throw when the spell is cast, but intelligent animals such as great apes or whales are allowed a save versus Spells to resist. Once in effect, the charm lasts until removed by a dispel magic spell or until the animal makes a successful saving throw versus Spells. The charmed animal receives a saving throw to break the spell each day if it has 7+1 HD or more, every week if it has 5-6 HD, and every month if it has 4 HD or fewer. This spell does not grant the caster any special means of communication with the affected animal; if combined with speak with animals, this spell becomes significantly more useful.


#### Command Word

| Range:    | 10'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | 1 round

When a cleric casts this spell, he may give the target a one word command, which it obeys to the best of its ability. The single word must make sense as a single command, such as approach, drop, fall, flee, halt, surrender, sleep, etc. Although a target could be instructed to "die," this will only make the target faint for a single round. Note that the caster must be able to speak the language of the target. Any intended target with more than 5 HD or an INT of over 12 is entitled to a saving throw versus Spells. This spell is ineffective against undead.


#### Commune

| Range:    | self
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | 3 turns

This spell puts the caster in contact with the great powers he serves, who will answer three yes-or-no questions. The being contacted may or may not be omniscient, and further, though the being is technically allied with the caster, it may still not answer questions clearly or completely. These details are left to the Judge's discretion. The ritual to cast this spell takes 1 turn to complete, and may be performed but once per week. Once a year, possibly upon the patron deity's feast day, the divine spellcaster may ask twice the normal number of questions.


#### Continual Light*

| Range:    | 360'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Arcane    | 2
| Duration: | special

This spell creates a spherical region of light, as bright as full daylight up to a 30' radius, and with lesser intensity to a radius of 60'. Continual light can be cast on an object, into the air, or at a creature, just as with the light spell, up to a maximum range of 360' from the caster.

As with light, this spell can be used to blind a creature if cast on its visual organs. Creatures targeted by this spell are allowed a save versus Death; if the save is made, the spell is cast into the air just behind the target creature. A penalty of -4 is applied to the blinded creature's attack throws if the saving throw fails.

The reversed spell, continual darkness, causes complete absence of light in the area of effect, overpowering normal light sources. Continual darkness may be used to blind just as continual light can. Any blindness ends when the spell ends.

Continual light and continual darkness are not permanent effects, but are instead effects that are indefinitely sustained by the caster without need for concentration. A caster may indefinitely sustain one continual light or continual darkness spell per level of experience. A truly permanent light requires a permanency ritual.

#### Create Food

| Range:    | 10'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | permanent

The food that this spell creates is simple fare of the caster's choice, highly nourishing, but rather bland. Up to 12 men and their mounts can be fed for one day with this spell. For every level of experience the divine spellcaster is above 8th, he is able to create food for 12 more men and their mounts. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting purify food and water on it.


#### Create Water

| Range:    | 10'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | permanent

This spell summons forth an enchanted spring from the ground or wall that will provide enough water for 12 men and their mounts for one day (50 gallons). For every level the divine spellcaster is above 8th, 12 additional men and mounts can be supplied. Note that one or more vessels to contain the water must be available at the time of casting. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water. Note: Water weighs about 1 stone (8lb, to be exact) per gallon, and one cubic foot of water is roughly 8 gallons.


#### Cure Blindness

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | instantaneous

With this spell the caster can cure a creature suffering blindness (whether caused by injury or by magic, including light or continual light). Blindness caused by a curse cannot be cured by this spell.


#### Cure Disease*

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | instantaneous

This spell cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from, including magical diseases as lycanthropy and mummy rot. Cure disease will also kill green slime and other parasites afflicting the target creature. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher. This spell does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease.

The reverse of this spell, cause disease, infects the target with a horrific wasting plague unless a save versus Spells is made. While afflicted, the target suffers -2 on attack throws, cannot be magically healed, and will naturally heal at half the normal rate. The disease will be fatal in 2d12 days unless a cure disease spell is cast on the victim.


#### Cure Light Wounds*

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | instantaneous

With this spell the caster heals 1d6+1 points of damage by laying his hand upon the injured creature. This spell may also be used to cure paralysis, but does not then cure any points of damage. The spell will never increase a creature's hit points beyond the normal amount.

The reverse form of this spell, cause light wounds, causes 1d6+1 damage to the creature affected by it. A successful attack throw is required in this case.

Undead are affected by this spell and its reverse in opposite fashion; they are injured by cure light wounds and healed by cause light wounds.


#### Cure Serious Wounds*

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | instantaneous

This spell works exactly like cure light wounds, save that it heals 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. The reverse, cause serious wounds, also works exactly like cause light wounds, except that it inflicts 2d6 + caster level in damage.


#### Delay Poison

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 1 turn per level

The subject becomes temporarily immune to poison. Any poison in its system or any poison to which it is exposed during the spell's duration does not affect the subject until the spell's duration has expired. Unless cured, saving throws and damage as appropriate are rolled once the spell ends. Delay poison does not cure any damage that poison may have already done. However, if the spell is cast on a subject who has recently died from poison, within 1 turn per caster level, life is restored until the spell duration ends. A revived character will have 1 hp for the duration of the spell, but if the spell ends prior to the poison being cured, the subject dies again.


#### Detect Evil*

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Arcane    | 2
| Duration: | 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to detect evil; specifically, the caster can detect creatures with evil intentions, magic items with evil enchantments, undead, sinkholes of evil, and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment. Note that normal characters, even if Chaotic, are not detected by this spell unless they have actively evil intentions against the caster. Poisons, physical traps, and natural animals are neither good nor evil, so they are not detected by this spell. The caster sees the evil creatures or objects with a definite red glow around them, but the glow cannot be seen by anyone else.

Reversed, this spell becomes detect good, which works just as described above with respect to detecting good enchantments, summoned creatures of Lawful alignment, and good intentions.


#### Detect Magic

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Arcane    | 1
| Duration: | 2 turns

The caster of this spell is able to detect enchanted or enspelled objects or creatures within the given range by sight, seeing them surrounded by a pale glowing yellow light. Only the caster sees the glow. Invisible creatures or objects are not detected by this spell, but the emanations of the invisibility magic will be seen as an amorphous glowing fog, possibly allowing the caster (only) to attack the invisible creature at an attack penalty of only -2.


#### Dispel Evil

| Range:    | 30'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | 1 turn

When this spell is cast, the caster can take no other action but concentrate on the spell for the entire duration. All undead or other enchanted creatures that come within 30' of the caster must succeed in a saving throw versus Death or be destroyed. Any creature that makes this saving throw will instead flee from the affected area. Instead of casting the spell in a 30' radius, the caster can direct the spell at one monster only, and that monster saves with a -2 penalty. Casting dispel evil upon an unholy place or shrine can sometimes rid the place of evil (Judge's discretion). In addition, dispel evil can be used to remove a cursed item from a being within the spell range; doing so discharges and ends the spell.


#### Dispel Magic

| Range:    | 120'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Arcane    | 3
| Duration: | instantaneous

The caster can use dispel magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, or to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within a cubic area 20' on a side. The caster must choose whether to cast dispel magic on a creature or object, or to affect an area.

If dispel magic is targeted at a creature, all spells and spell-like effects (including ongoing potion effects) may be canceled. If cast upon an area, all such effects within the area may be canceled. Any spell or effect cast by a character of equal or lower level than the dispel magic caster's level is ended automatically. Those created by higher level casters might not be canceled; there is a 5% chance the dispel magic will fail for each level the spell or effect exceeds the caster level. For example, a 10th level caster dispelling magic created by a 14th level caster has a 20% chance of failure.

Some spells cannot be ended by dispel magic; this specifically includes any magical disease, geas, quest, petrification from a flesh to stone spell, and any curse, including those created by bestow curse (the reverse of remove curse) as well as by cursed items.


#### Divination

| Range:    | self
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | special

Similar to augury but more powerful, a divination spell can provide the caster with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If the caster doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 60% + 1% per caster level. The Judge should roll this secretly. If the dice roll fails, false information is delivered.


#### Faerie Fire

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | 1 round per level

With this spell, the divine spellcaster can outline one or more creatures or objects with a pale, flickering greenish fire. The fire does not inflict any damage. The objects or creatures need only be detected in some way (such as by detect magic) to be the object of this spell. All attacks against the outlined creature or object gain a +2 bonus to attack throws, as it is more easily seen. The caster can outline 1 man-sized creature (about 12' of fire) for each 5 levels of experience, rounded up.

#### Feign Death

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | 6 rounds plus 1 round per level

The caster of this spell causes a state of death-like paralytic arrest in himself or another willing creature. This physical state completely mimics death to any observer, even if the creature is physically examined. To affect another creature, physical contact must be made and the target must have equal or fewer levels or HD to the caster. No saving throw is permitted. Any being under the effect of this spell is conscious and can hear and smell, but cannot move and is completely numb. Thus, if the body is damaged or otherwise molested, there will be no discomfort to the spell recipient and no physical reaction. Damage inflicted to a creature in this state is reduced by 50%, and poison, paralysis, or energy drain attacks are ineffective. However, any poison that retains its effective duration after the spell ends will affect the creature once the spell ends or is negated. The caster may negate the spell before the duration ends, but 1 round must pass for the body to resume normal life functions.


#### Fellowship

| Range:    | self
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | 1 turn per level

This spell causes the divine spellcaster to increase the feelings of camaraderie in those he interacts with. All creatures that socially interact with the spellcaster must make a saving throw versus Spells. All those failing the saving throw are very impressed by the caster and greatly desire to be his friend and assist him in any way they can, treating him as if his Charisma was 2d4 points higher than actual. Those who do not fail the saving throw are uneasy in the caster's presence and tend to find him irritating; they treat him as if his Charisma was 1d4 points lower. This spell has no effect on creatures of animal intelligence or lower.


#### Find Traps

| Range:    | 30'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 3 turns

This spell permits the caster to detect a variety of traps, both mechanical and magical. When the caster moves within 30' of a trap, he will see it glow with a faint blue aura. The caster is not, however, able to detect certain natural hazards such as quicksand, a sinkhole, or unsafe walls of natural rock. The spell also does not bestow the caster with the knowledge needed to disarm the trap, nor any details about its type or nature.



#### Flame Strike

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | instantaneous

A flame strike produces a vertical column of divine fire 30' high and 10' in diameter that roars downward on a target. The spell deals 6d8 points of damage. A successful saving throw versus Spells reduces the damage to 3d8.


#### Glyph of Warding

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | special

This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. The area of effect is up to 5' squared per caster level, and a maximum of 10' squared can be inscribed per round. A password is set when casting the spell, and any creature entering or touching the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password is subject to the magic it stores.

When casting the spell, the cleric weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of the total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.

Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.

Blast Glyph: A blast glyph deals 2 points of damage per caster level to intruders. This damage is fire or electricity, chosen by the caster at the time of casting. Each creature affected can attempt a saving throw versus Spell to take half damage.

Spell Glyph: The caster can store a harmful spell to be triggered. Spells may include those that cause blindness, paralysis, and energy drain, or similar effects. The cleric must be of a high enough level to cast these spells. A saving throw of the appropriate category (based on the spell) is allowed to avoid the effects of this kind of glyph.


#### Growth of Animals

| Range:    | 120'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | 12 turns

This spell causes an animal to grow to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. The affected creature will deal double normal damage with all physical attacks, and its existing natural Armor Class will increase by 2. The animal's carrying capacity is also doubled. Unfriendly animals may save versus Spells to resist this spell; normally, domesticated animals will not attempt to resist it, though they may become confused or panicked afterward (at the Judge's discretion).

All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.

The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals.

#### Hold Person

| Range:    | 180'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Arcane    | 3
| Duration: | 9 turns

This spell will render any living, non-undead humanoid creature paralyzed. Humanoid creatures include bugbears, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, hobgoblins, kobolds, lizardmen, men, mermen, morlocks, neanderthal, naiads, ogres, pixies, sprites, and troglodytes, and other creatures no larger than an ogre and possessing 4 or fewer Hit Dice. Humans and demi-humans may be affected regardless of character level. Targets of the spell are aware, and breathe normally, but cannot take any actions, including speech. A successful save versus Paralysis will negate the effect. The spell may be cast at a single person, who makes his or her save at -2, or at a group, in which case 1d4 of the creatures in the group may be affected.

A winged creature which is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls (if in flight at the time). A paralyzed swimmer can't swim and may drown.



#### Holy Chant

| Range:    | 0'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | special

This spell is intoned continuously, bringing about supernatural intervention centered on the divine spellcaster and affecting any party members within a 30' radius of the caster. All attack throws, damage rolls, and saving throws are made with a +1 bonus. Likewise, all of the rolls attempted by enemies suffer a -1 penalty. This effect continues so long as the caster does not move and focuses only on chanting. However, if he is successfully attacked and dealt damage, or otherwise physically distracted, the spell ends. The spell silence 15' radius also negates the spell.

#### Insect Plague

| Range:    | 480'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | 1 day

This spell summons a vast cloud of swarming insects (usually locusts) consisting of 4 insect [swarms](Chapter08.md#swarm) (as described in the Monsters chapter). Each swarm is 30' x 30' in size and possesses 4 Hit Dice. The swarms must be summoned so that each one is adjacent to at least one other swarm (that is, the swarms must fill one contiguous area). The caster may summon the swarms so that they share the area of other creatures. Each swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area, and the whole plague will obscure vision and automatically drive off creatures of less than 3 Hit Dice. The caster must concentrate for the duration of the spell to maintain control over the insect plague. The caster loses control of it if he is successfully attacked or if the insect plague leaves the range of the caster. While the caster has control over the insect plague, he can move its constituent swarms 20' per round. The swarms are stationary once the caster loses control of the insect plague.



#### Light*

| Range:    | 120'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Arcane    | 1
| Duration: | 6 turns plus 1 turn per level

This spell creates a light equal to torchlight which illuminates a 30' radius area (and provides dim light for an additional 20') around the target location or object. The effect is immobile if cast into an area, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.

Reversed, light becomes darkness, creating an area of darkness just as described above. This darkness blocks out infravision and negates mundane light sources.

A light spell may be cast to counter and dispel the darkness spell of an equal or lower level caster (and vice versa). Doing so causes both spells to instantly cease, restoring the existing ambient light level.

Either version of this spell may be used to blind an opponent by means of casting it on the target's ocular organs. The target is allowed a saving throw versus Spells to avoid the effect, and if the save is made, the spell does not take effect at all. A light or darkness spell cast to blind does not have the given area of effect (that is, no light or darkness is shed around the victim).



#### Locate Object

| Range:    | 120'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Arcane    | 2
| Duration: | 6 turns

This spell allows the caster to sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. He can search for general items, in which case the nearest one of its kind is located if more than one is within range. The caster cannot specify a unique item unless he or she has observed that particular item firsthand (not through divination). The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead or gold. Creatures cannot be found by this spell.




#### Neutralize Poison*

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | instantaneous

This spell detoxifies any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A poisoned creature suffers no additional effects from the poison; if cast upon a creature slain by poison in the last 10 rounds, the creature is revived with 1 hit point. If cast upon a poisonous object (such as a weapon, trap, etc.) the poison is rendered permanently ineffective.

Reversed, this spell becomes poison. The caster must make a successful attack throw; if the attack is a success, the target must save versus Poison or die. The caster's touch remains poisonous for 1 round per level of ability, or until discharged (i.e. only one creature can be affected by the reversed spell).

#### Prayer

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | 1 round per level

By means of a prayer spell, the divine spellcaster brings great favor upon himself and his party, and causes harm to his enemies. Once the prayer spell is cast, all attack throws, damage rolls, and saving throws made by those in range who are friendly to the caster are at +1, while those of the cleric's enemies are at -1. The prayer spell does not require the caster to concentrate once cast.


#### Projected Image

| Range:    | 240'
| :-------- | :------------
| Arcane    | 6
| Duration: | 6 turns

This spell creates a quasi-real, illusory version of the caster. The intangible projected image looks, sounds, and smells like the caster, in addition to mimicking gestures and actions, including speech. Any further spells cast seem to originate from the illusion, not the actual caster. A line of sight between the caster and his illusory self must be maintained or the spell ends. Dimension door, teleport, or any similar spell that breaks the line of sight dispels the image, as does the illusionary caster being struck in combat. Note that this spell grants no special sensory powers to the caster; for example, if the illusory self is positioned so as to be able to see something the caster can't directly see, the caster does not see it. Also, all spell ranges are still figured from the caster's actual position, not the illusory self's position.


#### Protection from Evil*

| Range:    | self
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Arcane    | 1
| Duration: | concentration

This spell creates a magical barrier of protection around the caster with a 10' radius. The barrier surrounds the caster for the duration of the spell and provides some protection from attacks by "evil" creatures. For purposes of this spell, evil creatures include hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster's alignment, and inherently evil creatures such as undead and summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment. All within the radius gain a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Those who leave and then re-enter, or who enter after the spell is cast, receive the protection as well.

In addition, the spell prevents bodily contact by enchanted (constructed, summoned, or undead) creatures, regardless of whether they are "evil" or not. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The spell's protection against contact by enchanted creatures ends if the caster or any protected creature makes an attack against, casts a spell on, or tries to force the barrier against a blocked creature.

The protection lasts as long as the caster remains stationary and concentrates on it.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. Like its counterpart, protection from good protects the caster from attacks by hostile creatures of an alignment other than the caster's and prevents bodily contact by enchanted creatures. However, instead of protecting the caster from inherently evil creatures (e.g. summoned creatures of Chaotic alignment), protection from good protects the caster from inherently good creatures (e.g. summoned creatures of Lawful alignment).


#### Protection from Evil, Sustained*

| Range:    | 0'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Arcane    | 3
| Duration: | 12 turns

This spell functions exactly as protection from evil, but with a duration of 12 turns. The barrier will move with the caster, who does not need to concentrate to maintain its protection.

Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good, sustained, and functions exactly as the reversed form of protection from evil, except with a duration of 12 turns without the need for concentration.

#### Purify Food and Water

| Range:    | 10'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | Instantaneous

This spell makes spoiled, rotten, poisonous, or otherwise contaminated food and water pure and suitable for eating and drinking. This spell will purify one ration of food, 6 skins of water, or enough normal food to feed a dozen people. This spell does not prevent subsequent natural decay or spoilage. Unholy water and similar food and drink of significance is spoiled by purify food and water, but the spell has no effect on creatures of any type, nor upon magic potions.


#### Quest*

| Range:    | 30'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | special

Quest places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service, or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by the caster. The target creature must be able to understand the caster for this spell to take effect. While a quest cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

A saving throw versus Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a quest when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the quest, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service.

The affected creature must follow the given instructions until the quest is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

A character who ignores a quest will suffer cumulative penalties (decided by the Judge) until the character obeys the quest or dies. Suitable penalties include penalties in combat, lowered ability scores, loss of spells, and pain and weakness ending in death. The penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the quest.

A quest (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell from a caster two or more levels higher than the caster of the quest, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel magic does not affect a quest spell.


#### Restore Life and Limb*

| Range:    | touch (120')
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | instantaneous

This spell restores life to a deceased creature (excluding creatures which are not truly alive, such as constructs, elementals, and undead). The caster can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than two days at 7th level, and four days are added per level above 7. For example, a 9th level caster can bring a character back to life that has been dead for 10 days. However, this spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age, lost its head, or had its body cremated.

Because it repairs even lethal damage and regrows flesh and bone, this spell can also heal a character of any permanent wounds, such as lost limbs, disfiguring scars, or shattered spines (see the [Mortal Wounds](Chapter06.md#mortal-wounds) table in Chapter 6 for details on permanent wounds).Despite this spell's beneficial results, tampering with the body and soul is never without risk. Each time a character benefits from restore life and limb, he must roll on the [Tampering with Mortality](Chapter06.md#tampering-with-mortality) table in Chapter 6 and apply these results.

If restore life and limb is ever cast on an undead monster, the monster must save versus Death or be instantly destroyed.

The reverse of this spell, finger of death, creates a death ray that will kill any one creature unless a save versus Death is made. Lawful clerics may only use finger of death in life-or-death situations against Chaotic foes.



#### Remove Curse*

| Range:    | 30'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Arcane    | 4
| Duration: | instantaneous

Remove curse instantaneously removes all curses on an object or a creature. If cast on a cursed item, remove curse does not remove the curse from the item, but it enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it. Any curse cast by a character of equal or lower level than remove curse caster's level is ended automatically. Those curses bestowed by higher level casters might not be removed; there is a 5% chance the remove curse will fail for each level the cursing character's level exceeds the level of the caster removing the curse. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell at all, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.

The reverse of this spell, bestow curse, allows the caster to place a curse on a target creature or object. A saving throw versus Spells is allowed to resist. The caster must choose one of the following four effects:

-  -4 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1).
-  -4 penalty on attack throws and saves.
-  Prime requisite halved (minimum 1).
-  Each round of combat, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

The caster may also invent his own curse, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse thus bestowed cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a remove curse spell. There is no limit to the number of different curses a character may suffer from.


#### Remove Fear*

| Range:    | touch (120')
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | instantaneous (2 turns)

This spell will calm the creature touched and remove all fear. If the subject is currently running away due to magical fear, it is allowed a new saving throw to resist that fear, at a bonus of +1 per level of the caster.

The reverse of this spell, cause fear, causes one target creature within 120' to become frightened; if the target fails to save versus Death, it flees for 2 turns. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are immune to this effect.


#### Resist Cold

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | 6 turns

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to cold. Minor cold (such as exposure to winter weather in inadequate clothing) is ignored by the subject creature. Against more significant cold (such as the breath of a White Dragon), the subject creature gains a bonus of +2 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by -1 point per die of damage rolled. Any cold attacks will still inflict at least 1 point of damage per die rolled, however.


#### Resist Fire

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 6 turns

This abjuration grants a creature temporary immunity to fire and heat. Minor heat or fire (such as exposure to normal flames) is ignored by the subject creature. Against more significant heat or fire (such as a fireball), the subject creature gains a bonus of +2 on saving throws, and all damage from such attacks is reduced by -1 point per die of damage rolled. Any fire attacks will still inflict at least 1 point of damage per die rolled, however.


#### Sanctuary

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 1
| Duration: | 2 rounds plus 1 round per level

Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the warded creature must attempt a saving throw versus Spells. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent will not attack the warded creature and will attack another creature instead. However, area effects (e.g. fireball) may still affect the warded creature. The warder creature may not make offensive actions while this spell is in effect, but he may cast non-offensive spells to help companions.



#### Shimmer

| Range:    | self
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 1 turn per level

This spell surrounds the bladedancer with a shimmering aura. The aura provides a bonus of +2 to all saving throws. Attack throws against the bladedancer are at -2.

Silence 15' Radius

| Range:    | 180'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 12 turns

Upon the casting of this spell, complete silence prevails within a 15' radius around the target. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the area. The spell can be cast on a point in space, making the effect stationary, or it may be cast on a mobile object. The spell can be centered on a creature, and the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature receives a save versus Spells to negate the spell. If an item in another creature's possession is targeted, that creature also receives a save versus Spells to negate. This spell provides a defense against sonic or language-based attacks or spells.



#### Smite Undead*

| Range:    | 240' (touch)
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | special

This spell instantly destroys a number of Hit Dice of undead equal to the caster's level. All the undead must be within a 60' diameter sphere. Any excess levels of effectiveness are lost. Skeletons and zombies receive no saving throw against this spell; all other undead are allowed a saving throw versus Death to avoid the effect. Undead with 8 or more Hit Dice or levels are immune to the spell.

The reverse of this spell, animate dead, functions exactly like the 5th level arcane spell of the same name.


#### Snake Charm

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | see below

The divine spellcaster is able to affect the behavior of snakes, making them indifferent to the caster and others. A caster is able to affect snakes of a number of Hit Die equaling the caster's level. A 7th level caster can affect 7 Hit Dice of snakes, which can equal seven 1 HD snakes, or two 3 HD snakes and one 1 HD snake, or any other combination. A snake that is attacked will defend itself against its attacker, but will continue to remain indifferent to others. Attacking one charmed snake does not break the charm on the others.

Hostile snakes are more difficult to charm, and if this spell is cast on snakes that are engaged in melee combat with the caster, the snakes will only be affected by the spell for 1d4+1 rounds. If the spell is cast on snakes that are not hostile at the moment, the spell will last 1d4+1 turns.


#### Speak with Animals

| Range:    | special
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 6 turns

The caster can comprehend and communicate with any one normal or giant animal that is in sight of the caster and able to hear him. It will not affect intelligent animal races or fantastic creatures. The caster may change which animal he is speaking with at will, once per round. The spell doesn't alter the animal's reaction or attitude towards the caster; a standard reaction roll should be made to determine this. Furthermore, more intelligent animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while less intelligent ones make inane comments. However, if an animal is friendly toward the caster, it may be willing to grant some favor or service.


#### Speak with Plants

| Range:    | 30'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | 3 turns

The caster can comprehend and communicate with both normal plants and plant creatures. A normal plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't alter the plant's reaction or attitude towards the caster; however, normal plants will generally communicate freely with the caster, as they have nothing else of importance to do. Intelligent plant creatures are more likely to be terse and evasive, behaving in much the same fashion as any other monster. If a plant creature is friendly toward the caster, it may decide to do some favor or service for him. Normal plants are usually not animate, and thus cannot generally perform "services" other than to answer questions.


#### Speak with Dead

| Range:    | 10'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | 1 turn

This spell grants the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it to answer several questions that the caster puts to it. The caster may ask one question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any). Answers are often brief, cryptic, or repetitive.

If the corpse has been subject to speak with dead within the past week, the new spell fails. The caster can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least have a mouth in order to speak at all.

This spell does not let the caster actually speak to the creature's soul. It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge "stored" in the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn new information. Indeed, it won't even remember being questioned.

This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.


#### Spiritual Weapon

| Range:    | 30'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 2
| Duration: | 1 round/level

This spell causes a weapon made of pure force to spring into existence, attacking any foe chosen by the divine spellcaster within range once per round. It deals 1d6 points of damage per strike, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum of +4). It uses the caster's normal attack throws, striking as a magical weapon, and thus can inflict damage upon creatures that are only hit by magic weapons. If the spiritual weapon goes beyond the spell range, the divine spellcaster loses sight of it, or the caster ceases to direct it, the weapon disappears. The weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod of cancellation will dispel it. The spiritual weapon will be of a type appropriate to the cleric and his deity.


#### Sticks to Snakes

| Range:    | 120'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | 6 turns

This spell transforms 2d8 normal wooden sticks into normal [snakes](Chapter08.md#snake) per every four caster levels. (See the Monsters chapter for details on types of snakes.)  There is a 50% chance the snakes will be poisonous. The snakes follow the commands of the caster. When slain, dispelled, or the spell expires, the snakes return to their original stick form. Magical "sticks" such as enchanted staffs cannot be affected.


#### Strength of Mind*

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | 12 turns

This spell gives a bonus of +4 to saving throws versus Death, Staffs, Wands, Paralysis, Petrification, and Spells to the creature touched. The reverse spell, weakness of mind, decreases the touched creature's saving throws by -4; no saving throw is allowed against Weakness of Mind.


#### Striking

| Range:    | 30'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 3
| Duration: | 3 turns

This spell bestows upon one weapon within range the ability to deal 1d6 points of additional damage. This extra damage is applied on each successful attack for the duration of the spell. It provides no bonus to attack throws, but if cast on a normal weapon, the spell allows monsters only hit by magical weapons to be affected; only the 1d6 points of magical damage applies to such a monster, however.


#### Sword of Fire

| Range:    | 0'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | 12 turns

On casting this spell, a sword of fire appears in the divine spellcaster's hand. The sword is magical and has bonuses to attack throws and damage rolls equal to the caster's level divided by 3 (round up). The sword will set alight inflammable substances, and can harm undead and incorporeal creatures. The divine spellcaster can cause the sword to appear and disappear at will, enabling him to cast spells and carry out other activities.




#### Tongues*

| Range:    | 60'
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | 1 turn

This spell grants the divine spellcaster the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature within a 60' radius around the caster.

The reverse, garble, can be cast on any intelligent creature within 60' of the caster. No saving throw is permitted. If the target is the beneficiary of a tongues spell, garble will negate the tongues spell; otherwise, garble will render the target unable to speak and understand the languages of other intelligent creatures. While unable to communicate with others, the target may still think clearly and understand his own words, so garble does not prevent the target from casting spells. Indeed, the target may not immediately realize he is under the effects of a garble - he may think something is wrong with the creatures around him who can't understand what he's saying.



#### True Seeing

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 5
| Duration: | 1 turn plus 1 round per level

This spell confers on the subject the ability to see all things as they actually are. The subject sees through normal and magical darkness, notices secret doors, sees the exact locations of displaced creatures or objects, sees through normal or magical disguises, sees invisible creatures or objects normally, sees through illusions, and sees the true form of polymorphed, changed, or transmuted things. The range of true seeing conferred is 120'.

True seeing, however, does not penetrate solid objects. It in no way confers X-ray vision or its equivalent. It does not negate concealment, including that caused by fog and the like. In addition, the spell's effects cannot be further enhanced with known magic, so one cannot use true seeing through a crystal ball or in conjunction with clairvoyance.

#### Vigor

| Range:    | touch
| :-------- | :------------
| Divine    | 4
| Duration: | 1 turn per level

The subject of this spell receives a bonus of +2 to saving throws, an additional 1d10 hit points, and a 1d3 bonus to Strength. The extra hit points cannot be restored by healing and are the first lost whenever the character takes damage. Strength may be increased to a maximum of 19. A character with Strength 19 gains a +4 bonus to attack throws and damage rolls.
